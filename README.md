# MDBSE
The main objective of the project is to enable the user to easily search for the cinematic work they would like to watch. 
This involves presenting them with the different characteristics of each work and being able to classify them according 
to several criteria such as the year or country of production.

1) Read the report (french version only) : MDB_Khangz_Report
2) Open MDB_Khangz to use the search engine or to improve it
